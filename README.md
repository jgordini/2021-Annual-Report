> This includes attracting, recruiting, admitting and retaining the Corps of Cadets who will become future leaders. The goal also includes attracting, recruiting and hiring excellent staff and faculty who will educate, train and inspire cadets. This goal supports a **blend of excellence** at USMA that reflects diversity in our Army and contributes to the collective strength of the Academy. By leveraging individual talents and backgrounds, these diverse teams will more effectively accomplish the mission. These teams can only be created in an environment where all teammates feel safe and respected; therefore, sexual assault and harassment is not tolerated.
